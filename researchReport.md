### *Using Eye Movement Data and Visit Contexts to Understand the Experience of Museum Visitors* Yuan-Chi Tseng, An-Hou Tang, Yu-Hsuan Shih, Sheng-Fu Liang.

The group developed a system using commercially available glasses that track a wearer's eye movement.

I think the findings could have been strengthened by collecting more data on the participants. Not just tracking eyes, but looking for other physical indicators such as heart rate or body temperature. This way they could have more evidence to support some of their claims, rather than just considering the variation in blinking frequency.

This paper served as a strong reminder to me that while we have been focusing on creating a design that our museum visitor users will enjoy, we can also use our design to help the curators and museum staff. The way in which people interact with our design, the very measurable and trackable ways in which they engage with past shows of various galleries, can be used to inform future shows.
