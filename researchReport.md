### *Using Eye Movement Data and Visit Contexts to Understand the Experience of Museum Visitors*

#### Yuan-Chi Tseng, An-Hou Tang, Yu-Hsuan Shih, Sheng-Fu Liang

This group conducted a user test to show the connection between eye movement data and a visitor's experience. They combined JINS MEME eyewear with a micro-recorder and analysis software to collect data on six participants who had their eye movements tracked as they visited an experimental exhibition in the Asia University Museum of Modern Art. They focused on the rate of blinking, considering three degrees of frequency: many-blink, few-blink, and no-blink. By comparing eye data to the task the user was conducting at that time, the group found an association between each type of blinking and a type of experience, which they classified as Sense, Feel, Act, Think, and Relate.

I think the findings could have been strengthened by collecting more data on the participants: not just tracking eyes, but looking for other physical indicators such as heart rate or body temperature. In this way they could have more evidence to support some of their claims, rather than just considering the variation in blinking frequency. However, I found it important that they were able to collect strong evidence that physical reactions can be used in assessing a visitor's experience in a museum.

This paper served as a strong reminder to me that while we have been focusing on creating a design that our museum visitor users will enjoy, we can also use our design to help the curators and museum staff. The way in which people interact with our design, the very measurable and trackable ways in which they engage with past shows of various galleries, can be used to inform future shows.
