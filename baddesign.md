Last year, I locked myself out of (and my key inside) my room 3 times in 1 semester. Each time I called Security (or walked to Hopkins as I'd also locked my phone in my room),

One position means the outer knob is locked, the other means unlocked, and I have already forgotten which is which.

The only way to know with confidence that you have unlocked your door on your exit to the shower is to do a quick test on the outer-facing knob to ensure that you will, in fact, be able to re-enter your room and not need to desperately knock on doors in your towel begging your neighbours to call security for you.
