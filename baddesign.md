Last year, I locked myself out of (and my key inside) my room 3 times in 1 semester. Each time I called Security (or walked to Hopkins as I'd also locked my phone in my room), it was a $15 fee and at least 1 hour of waiting on top of the mild guilt of wasting their time.

Unfortunately, this year I again wound up in a dorm with locks requiring physical keys. Especially unfortunately, on top of struggling to always remember my key, I'm also struggling to simply understand the lock on my new door knob.

The inner knob has a piece that can be rotated so that it is either perpendicular to the floor or parallel to it. One position means the outer knob is locked, the other means unlocked, and I have already forgotten which is which.

The only way to know with confidence that you have unlocked your door on your exit to the shower is to do a quick test on the outer-facing knob to ensure that you will, in fact, be able to re-enter your room and not need to desperately knock on doors in your towel begging your neighbours to call security for you.
