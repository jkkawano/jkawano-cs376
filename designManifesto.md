title: Design Manifesto
subtitle: The 5 Key Features of Good Design
---

Creating a good design requires the careful consideration of both the user and the design itself. In my following manifesto, I will describe what I have learned to consider to be the 5 most significant aspects of a “good design”, reflecting on the lessons and experiences from this course in which they were especially exemplified. I believe it is important to create things. More than that, though, I believe it is important to create things not just for the sake of creating them, but to better the world and people’s experiences with it.

### 1. Good design satisfies a need ###

A good design should be motivated by a real problem and the only way to know whether or not people care about a problem is to actually talk to people. We spent a significant portion of the semester “looking to understand”, meaning that before we even began to prototype or envision our design, we took numerous steps to talk to our target users and learn about them.

We began this project with only a brief fly-on-the-wall observation at the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA) and from that came up with a problem we wanted to approach. We then conducted a series of contextual inquiries at the museum in which we had participants complete two tasks related to learning more about their current space. Participants were asked to ‘think out loud’, explaining to us all of their actions and the reasonings behind them. (More details on our contextual inquiry and project-specific findings can be found [here](https://omondieric.github.io/whereYouArt/contextualReview))

### 2. Good design is functional ###

This may seem obvious, that a good design is one that works. But throughout our design process, it was apparent that it can be easy to overlook edge cases especially with unpredictable human users and when translating from an abstract concept to the actual design.

One of the ways we ensured a high level of functionality in our design was by mapping out task flows. These allowed us to see how a user might progress through our design, the logical connections between our different wireframes. We analyzed our design from the perspective of a user both trying to accomplish a given task and also just logically navigating through. It is important to consider both the tasks we want to provide for the user and also the user’s expectations of functionality. The design should be robust to any possible actions a user wants or expects to be able to do. As much as the design is our own creation, we still need to provide for the user’s wants and expectations.

On a lower level, good design should have good usability heuristics. In this course, the first time we actually created our designs and brought our ideas to life was in the form of a paper prototype. All the groups brought their paper prototypes to class to be tested through heuristic evaluations and as soon as we began to use each other’s designs, we quickly realized that none of our designs included “Back” buttons. In our first attempts to translate our designs from abstract concepts to something tangible and interactive, we had all neglected a small, but functionally necessary component.

### 3. Good design is accessible ###

Good design should be inclusive. Regardless of your target or intended user, your design should be accessible to users with a range of abilities. This means specific details, like ensuring all of your images have descriptive alt text and checking that a screen reader can logically navigate your structure, and more high-level ones like having a simple and consistent layout without large, heavy blocks of text. We were introduced to a poster series on the “Dos and don’ts of designing for accessibility” by the U.K. government that I found incredibly helpful. The graphics are both compelling and memorable. For the many small details that can sometimes be overlooked when actually creating a design, these are posters to which I will continue to refer.

Overall, accessibility in your design helps everyone. Not having massive blocks of text makes it more readable and interesting for everyone. Making buttons descriptive and large allows everyone to navigate your design more easily. We cannot exclude users simply because they have different abilities than us, after all one of the most repeated sentiments of this course has been that the user is not like us. We are all just temporarily able-bodied. A good design must be accessible.

### 4. Good design is ethical ###



### 5. Good design is delightful ###

A good design should not frustrate the user, rather the user should enjoy their experience with the design. While it is impossible to completely guarantee that every individual will have a positive experience, there are steps we can take to test

We had the opportunity this semester to talk to professionals currently working in industry on UX design and UX research. One of these individuals was Chloe Fan, a project designer for Uber. On her website, Chloe states: “I design beautiful, everyday experiences that help people make the most out of their lives.” I found this statement incredibly compelling and had the opportunity to ask if she could expand upon what she meant by “beautiful”. In her explanation, she said that one feature of “beautiful design” is that it should bring delight.
