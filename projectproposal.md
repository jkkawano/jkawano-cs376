# The Problem

It is very difficult to collect quantitative data on a visitor's experience in a museum, specifically WCMA.

### Why it matters
The more information a museum has on its visitors and their engagement with the art, the galleries, and beyond, the better the more effectively they can design their programming. The need for quantitative data on visitor experience is particularly important for WCMA because of their openness to taking risks in exploring their role as a museum. Knowing the details of their impact on visitors provides valuable feedback and can be used to justify funding.

### Current methods
The primary method for collecting data on visitor experience is to survey random visitors. This method is effective for collecting strong, direct testimony and improves the relationship between visitors and the museum as the visitor is able to engage with the museum staff themselves.

The main issues with this method, though, is that feedback is only collected from a small, select group of people and this data is largely qualitative. It also requires a significant amount of time and effort on the part of the museum staff.

# A Solution

An unobtrusive means of collecting quantitative data on a visitor's experience, while enhancing (and not hindering) that visitor's engagement with the museum.

### Goals
- For the museum, collect data on: which galleries a visitor went to, how long they were in each one, which pieces did they spend the most time with, etc.
- For the visitor, augment their experience and help them engage with the museum in a more meaningful way.

### What this might look like
A mobile app that would utilise a tablet or smartphone's camera so user's could scan pieces to learn more information, or just take pictures of their favourite pieces. The museum would track this information, in addition to collecting data on the visitor's movement throughout the galleries, and potentially more.
